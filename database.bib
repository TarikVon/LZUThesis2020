  abstract     = {The thermal rectification phenomenon in a one-dimensional asymmetric system of two thin films with different temperature-dependent thermal conductivities is studied. Based on the traditional thermal diffusion equation, the optimization condition for maximizing the thermal rectification ratio is re-examined; a new sufficient condition is found that the interface temperatures in the forward and reverse heat transfer directions should be equal, regardless of how the thermal conductivities depend on temperature. In other words, the thermal rectification ratio is maximized when the temperature dependence of the thermal conductivity over the entire operating temperature range is fully exploited. This sufficient condition can be used to find out the optimal geometric parameters of nanostructures which determine the effective thermal conductivity. An illustration of an asymmetric system composed of monolayer graphene sheet (GS) and graphene nanomesh (GNM) is presented. This study is beneficial to the development of thermal devices such as thermal resistors, thermal diodes, and thermal logic circuits.},

  abstract     = {Thermal conductivity is a critical material property in numerous applications, such as those related to thermoelectric devices and heat dissipation. Effectively modulating thermal conductivity has become a great concern in the field of heat conduction. Here, a quantum modulation strategy is proposed to modulate the thermal conductivity/heat flux by exciting targeted phonons. It shows that the thermal conductivity of graphene can be tailored in the range of 1559 W m−1 K−1 (decreased to 49\%) to 4093 W m−1 K−1 (increased to 128\%), compared with the intrinsic value of 3189 W m−1 K−1. The effects are also observed for graphene nanoribbons and bulk silicon. The results are obtained through both density functional theory calculations and molecular dynamics simulations. This novel modulation strategy may pave the way for quantum heat conduction.},

  abstract     = {The exceptional thermal conductivity and strength of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) position them as outstanding materials for thermal conduction. The intriguing properties introduced by van der Waals (vdW) heterojunctions have also captured the interest of researchers. However, further refinement of the research concerning the integration of these two elements is required. In our study, a vdW heterostructure with asymmetric layer nesting of multiwalled CNTs (ALCNTs) is devised, with a specific focus on the model’s heat flux and thermal rectification (TR) properties, which are analyzed using nonequilibrium molecular dynamics (NEMD). Notably, the greatest TR ratio is observed in the connection of three-layer and single-layer ALCNTs. Moreover, multilayer variable-length nested models exhibit a sluggish TR ratio. An examination of the interface thermal resistance (ITR) reveals that the maximum ITR in the multilayer nested model resides at the rightmost interface. However, it is essential to highlight that the determinant of the TR ratio and heat flux in the multilayer nested model is not the maximum ITR of the rightmost interface but rather the ITR of the outermost layer on the left. Additionally, the impacts of the defect density, length, temperature difference, and hydrogenation on the model’s heat flux and TR are explored, yielding noteworthy conclusions. For instance, defects in the outer CNT have a minimal influence on the heat flux and TR compared with those in the inner CNT. As the length increases, the heat flux initially decreases and then increases. Hydrogenation significantly enhances the model’s heat flux but does not favor the TR. Our study contributes to advancing the understanding of CNT vdW heterojunctions and offers valuable insights for their practical applications.},

Here, we propose a MOF nanozyme-mediated AChE-free colorimetric strategy for the direct detection of OPs. In the presence of OPs (pirimiphos-methyl as a model), the intense blue of oxidized 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) becomes light due to the quenching effect of OPs towards hydroxyl radicals (˙OH) that are generated by the decomposition of H               2               O               2               catalyzed by the Cu               4               Co               6               ZIF nanozyme with excellent peroxidase (POD)-like activity.
